# MahdiInsteadOfNess

Mahdi has arrived. This mod replaces Ness with **Mahdi**—a barefoot guy in blue pajamas, wielding a crowbar, who fights, talks to NPCs, and hijacks cutscene dialogues like a legend.

---

## 🎮 What This Mod Does

- Replaces **Ness** with **Mahdi** in the game.  
- **Barefoot** and wearing **blue pajamas** at all times.  
- The **bat is replaced with a crowbar**—Mahdi swings with style.  
- **Cutscene dialogues** are modified: Mahdi speaks where Ness would, then Paula or other characters respond after him.  
- Mahdi can still **fight normally**, but also adds chaotic, funny dialogue to cutscenes.  
- Interacts with NPCs in a personal, Mahdi-approved way.

Mahdi doesn’t just fight—he talks, he interrupts cutscenes, he exists. Pure chaos. Pure Mahdi.
